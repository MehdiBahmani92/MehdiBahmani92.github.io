                <h3>Continuum manipulator</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involves the development of a robotic arm composed of three modular units, each featuring a spring-based backbone.
                    Each module is equipped with its own microcontroller unit (MCU) and a comprehensive array of sensors, including three load cells for torque measurement, eight proximity sensors, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
                    This design enables independent operation of each module, while a serial communication bus runs along the length of the arm to interconnect the three modules.
                    This bus facilitates wireless communication with a PC, allowing for real-time monitoring and control of individual modules as well as the entire arm.
                    <br>
                    In this configuration, each module provides two degrees of freedom (DoF), resulting in a total of six DoF for the complete arm.
                    The inherent redundancy of this setup enhances its suitability for operation in confined environments, as each module can adeptly avoid collisions.
                    However, any minor orientation adjustments in the first or second modules can lead to changes in the coordinate system of the third module, necessitating careful path planning.
                    This task is managed on the PC, which processes data transmitted from each module and sends synchronization commands back to ensure cohesive movement.
                    The inverse kinematics calculations for the robotic arm are performed at a frequency of 10 Hz, resulting in smooth and precise motion across the entire arm.

                <h3>Awareness Detector</h3>
                <p>This project involved the development and integration of an advanced driver awareness detection system as an addon for car tracking devices, specifically designed for intercity buses.
                    Our team engineered the tracking device with additional I/O ports and serial interfaces to support future enhancements.
                    The Awareness Detector leverages these ports to interface seamlessly with the primary tracking device.
                    <br>
                    <b>Key Features:</b> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Infrared (IR) Imaging:</b> Utilizes IR technology to monitor the driver's eye openness and head angle.</li>
                        <li><b>Real-Time Monitoring:</b> Continuously assesses the driver's alertness by detecting if the eyes are closed or the head is tilted beyond 25 degrees.</li>
                        <li><b>Alert Mechanism:</b> If the system detects that the driver's eyes remain closed or the head stays tilted for more than 1 second, it triggers an alarm and displays a notification on the module’s LCD screen.</li>
                        <li><b>Communication with Control Center:</b> Sends an SMS alert and a GPRS message to the control center for logging and future analysis.</li>

                <h3>Mixer Controller</h3>
                <p>
                    This project represents one of my earliest freelancing endeavors, where I successfully designed and manufactured a controller unit for regulating mixer temperature and spinning direction, while also providing user alerts for potential issues.
                    This project highlights my ability to integrate both analog and digital components, as well as high-voltage (HV) and low-voltage (LV) signals within a single printed circuit board (PCB).
                    The controller unit features a compact switching regulator that efficiently converts 220V AC to 12V DC at 2A, ensuring a reliable power supply for the relays.
                    This regulator was carefully designed to minimize electromagnetic interference with the digital circuitry, thereby maintaining signal integrity.
                    <br>
                    The digital section of the board is powered by a linear regulator, which provides a stable voltage for the microcontroller and associated components.
                    To ensure robust isolation between the high-voltage and digital sections of the circuit, I implemented a series of optocouplers that effectively trigger the relays while protecting the microcontroller from potential voltage spikes.
                    The selected microcontroller incorporates internal EEPROM, eliminating the need for external memory components and thus enhancing cost efficiency.
                    <br>
                    Initially, the design included an LCD display for real-time monitoring of system modes and timers.
                    However, upon request from the project contractor to reduce costs, I adapted the final version of the system to feature two seven-segment displays that exclusively indicate the timers.
                    This change not only streamlined the design but also contributed to a more compact and efficient PCB layout.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, the board includes four push buttons that allow users to initiate the system and adjust the timers.
                    These settings are saved to the internal EEPROM upon pressing the "set" button, ensuring that user preferences are retained even after power loss.
                    <br>
                    Overall, this project showcases my proficiency in designing mixed-signal PCBs that accommodate both high and low voltage components, as well as my capacity to adapt designs based on client feedback while maintaining functionality and cost-effectiveness.
